# Elipsoide Frame Model

Machine learning algorithm for *supervised* clustering scennarios.

Motivation:
> To generalize clustering data
>
> To receive and categorise new data according to degree of belongings.

Objective:
> Input: Dataset with points anotated per cluster;
>
> Output: Degree of Belonging.

Degree of Belonging:
Vector capable of indicating how much does a new data point fits into every single class.

Sample in python is available in elpm/extra. Currently trying to build a sloopy version in Rust for greater performance.
